                    <p class = "subtitle-p subtitle-p-1">Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993,[26][27][28] by Jensen Huang (CEO as of 2024), a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems.[29][30] The three men founded the company in a meeting at a Denny's roadside diner in East San Jose (just off Interstate 680 at the Berryessa Road interchange).[31][32]
                        In 1993, the three co-founders envisioned that the ideal trajectory for the forthcoming wave of computing would be in the realm of accelerated computing, specifically in graphics-based processing. This path was chosen due to its unique ability to tackle challenges that eluded general-purpose computing methods.[33] They also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume; the two conditions do not happen very often.[33] Video games became the company's flywheel to reach large markets and fund huge R&D to solve massive computational problems.[33] With $40,000 in the bank, the company was born.[33] The company subsequently received $20 million of venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital and others.[34]
                        Nvidia initially had no name and the co-founders named all their files NV, as in "next version".[33] The need to incorporate the company prompted the co-founders to review all words with those two letters, leading them to "invidia", the Latin word for "envy".[33] The company's original headquarters office was in Sunnyvale, 
                        First graphics accelerator
                        Nvidia's first graphics accelerator product, the NV1, was optimized for processing quadratic primitives instead of the triangle primitives preferred by its competitors.[32] Then Microsoft introduced the DirectX platform, refused to support any other graphics software,[35] and also announced that its graphics software (Direct3D) would support only triangles.[32] In 1996, Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia's employees—then around 100—and focused the company's remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product optimized for processing triangle primitives: the RIVA 128.[32][35] By the time the RIVA 128 was released in August 1997</p>

                    <p class = "subtitle-p subtitle-p-3">Nvidia went public on January 22, 1999.[36][37][38]
                        In late 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256 (NV10), its first product expressly marketed as a GPU, which was most notable for introducing onboard transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.
                        Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft's Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. However, the project took many of its best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the GeForce2 GTS shipped in the summer of 2000. In December 2000, Nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its one-time rival 3dfx, a pioneer in consumer 3D graphics technology leading the field from the mid-1990s until 2000.[39][40] The acquisition process was finalized in April 2002.[41]
                        In 2001, Standard & Poor's selected Nvidia to replace the departing Enron in the S&P 500 stock index, meaning that index funds would need to hold Nvidia shares going forward.[42]
                        In July 2002, Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum. Exluna made software-rendering tools and the personnel were merged into the Cg project.[43] In August 2003, Nvidia acquired MediaQ for approximately US$70 million.[44] On April 22, 2004, Nvidia acquired iReady, also a provider of high-performance TCP/IP and iSCSI offload solutions.[buzzword][45] In December 2004, it was announced that Nvidia would assist Sony with the design of the graphics processor (RSX) in the PlayStation 3 game console. On December 14, 2005, Nvidia acquired ULI Electronics, which at the time supplied third-party southbridge parts for chipsets to ATI, Nvidia's competitor.[46] In March 2006, Nvidia acquired Hybrid Graphics.[47] In December 2006, Nvidia, along with its main rival in the graphics industry AMD (which had acquired ATI), received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry.[48]</p>
